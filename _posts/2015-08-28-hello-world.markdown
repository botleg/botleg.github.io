Welcome to botleg.

Botleg is a blog where you can find tutorials and techniques in web development, big data analysis, databases, cloud computing and anything related to technology. I'll share my experince solving some problems and any workarounds. If it is a walkthrough tutorial, I'll create a repository and share it with you.

This blog is made using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). If you are unfamiliar with it, it is a brilliant static site generator. I've used some tricks with it to add search and comment features to it. This blog is `open-source` and its code is hosted in [GitHub](https://github.com/botleg/botleg.github.io). The blog itself is hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), a free hosting service from GitHub for static websites. I'll also write about various techniques I have used in this blog.

You can subscribe to this blog via [RSS](http://botleg.com/feed), and I hope you do. So that's all about botleg and stay tuned for my next post.
